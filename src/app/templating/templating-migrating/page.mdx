# Legacy Template Migration
`Templating` is a brand new templating plugin for NotePlan, which has been designed to be an upgrade to the current `nmn.Templates` templating plugin.

The following guide provides steps necessary for migrating from `Templates` (aka `nmn.Templates`) to `Templating`

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="LEGACY TEMPLATING DISABLED AUTOMATICALLY"
  description={`
  
If you have installed <code>Templating</code> (see <a href="templating-installation" alt="installation">installation</a> for more information), the legacy version of Templates will be disabled automatically, no further action is required.</br>

It is strongly recommended that you allow <code>Templating</code> to migrate all your existing templates and disable legacy templating plugin as it assures most cases have been covered.
  `}
/>
#
## Upgrading Manually
If you have chosen to perform migration manually and have not installed `Templating`, you can still prepare your templates to work with `Templating`

The first step will be to validate your templates have migrated successfully when `Templating` was installed.

<Callout
  type="info"
  description={`
During the <code>Templating</code> installation process, all your templates which were located in your "ðŸ“‹ Templates" folder were migrated and converted to the <code>Templating</code> syntax. If you wish to run templating migration process manually, use the <code>np:migrate-templates</code> command.
  `}
/>

If you have templates which were not migrated correctly (we have attempted to cover all the possible templates, but there may be ones that `Templating` was not able to convert).

The following steps should be followed to convert your templates to `Templating` format.

### Step 1: Change Template Tags
`Templating` uses `<%-` and `%>` as opening and closing template tags (see <Link href="templating-tags">Template Tags</Link> for more information).

For example, if you are using something like the following:

```js
{{formattedDateTime({format: '%A, %B %d, %Y'})}}
```

Replace with

```js
<%- formattedDateTime({format: '%A, %B %d, %Y'}) %>
```

## Disable Legacy Templates
The final step will be disabling Legacy Templates plugin

### Step 1: Open NotePlan Preferences
`NotePlan -> Preferences...`

### Step 2: Select Plugins Tab

### Step 3: Disable Templates
Uncheck `Templates` checkbox to uninstall legacy Templates

### Step 4: Install `Templating`
For information on installing `Templating` see the <Link href="templating-installation">Templating Installation</Link>. 

### Step 5: Quit & Relaunch NotePlan
While it might not be necessary, it is safe to Quit & Relaunch NotePlan

### Step 6: Enjoy `Templating`
It is recommended that you read the remainder of the `Templating` documentation. Who reads docs, yes I too often skip this step, but there is a lot packed into `Templating` so it is good to get an overview of what's available!

At a minimum, have a look at all the <Link href="templating-examples-simple">examples</Link>. We have attempted all the various features of `Templating`. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach out to us!
