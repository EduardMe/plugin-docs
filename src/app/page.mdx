# NotePlan Plugins Documentation

NotePlan has a powerful plugin architecture that allows for the creation of many useful tools and additional functionality. Here you will find documentation for all of the currently available plugins for NotePlan. 

On the left, you will see a list of pages available. We recommend you start with the <Link href="pluginlist">Plugin List</Link>, or use the search function at the top of the page to find a specific plugin. 

## General Plugin Information
TK stuff here about how to install and launch plugins, the `/` notation, etc. 
Maybe include the secret dev plugin info?



## Plugin Development
TK link here on how to make plugins, maybe?

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community. {{ className: 'lead' }}
